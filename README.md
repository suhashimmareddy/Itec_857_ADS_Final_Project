# Itec_857_ADS_Final_Project
Trying to run Fast Text on the new data sets and explore whether text classification is performing a better job on identifying labels or no

## what we did
1) we had scrapped the data from stack exchange for the following four categories using Beautiful soup Package in python 
	1) Electronics
	2) Music & Movies
	3) Python
	4) Android
2) later we converted the scrapped data into the text format that is acceptable by fasttext
3) we ran all the availble fast text models from fast text tutorial (Text classification topic) allong with that we tuned them with several parameters to compare how the model performs each time with parameter tuned
4) We finally compared all the models output to find the best one for that Particular Dataset

## Whats's there in Git-hub repository
1) All the python working for scraping and coverting is available in respective folders with in python working folders
2) All the Screen shots for each Datasets are in respective folder with in Outputs folder
3) All the files related to latex are in Latex file folder
4) The Linux code to run the fasttext dataset is on the Linux code Folder
5) individually files of the pdf and doc version of latex are available.
